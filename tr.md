Let me help you fix this quickly. The issue is that your project files were transferred to the EC2 instance but npm can't find the package.json file in the right location.

Here's what we'll do:

Good! I can see your project folder "Dms Bizloan Pvt Ltd" is in the home directory. Let's fix the npm issue:

Let's continue checking the directory contents to find the package.json file:

I see the issue. The package.json file is missing in your EC2 instance. Let's copy it from your local machine to the EC2 instance:

Now let's transfer the package.json file to the EC2 instance:

Great! Now let's install the npm dependencies on the EC2 instance:

Let's check if we need to set up a .env file for your application:

Now let's copy the .env file to the EC2 instance:

Now, let's build and start the application on the EC2 instance:

Let's try running the build command again:

I see the issue. Let's install the dependencies globally and then try building:

Now let's try running the build command again:

I see the issue. The `src` directory with your pages and app directories might not have been transferred properly. Let's check and then transfer the src directory:

Now let's transfer the src directory to the EC2 instance:

Now let's also transfer the server.js file:

Now let's try building the application:

We need to create a jsconfig.json or tsconfig.json file to handle the path aliases. Let's transfer the tsconfig.json file:

Let's also transfer the tailwind.config.js file:

Now let's try building the application again:

Great! The build was successful despite some expected warnings about dynamic routes. Now let's start the application:

Now let's check if the application is running by checking the port:

Great! The application is running on the EC2 instance. Let's check if we can access it from outside:

Great! The application is running successfully on the EC2 instance. Now we need to make sure the necessary security group rules are in place to allow external access to the application:

Now let's set up a process manager like PM2 to keep the application running even after you disconnect:

Now let's stop the current running process and start it using PM2:

Let's check if PM2 is running the application:

Let's try starting the application with PM2 again:

Great! The application is now running with PM2. Let's set up PM2 to start on system boot:

Now let's run the startup command:

Let's try a different approach:

Now let's save the current PM2 process list so it will restart on system reboot:

Finally, let's check if the application is accessible from the outside:

Let's check if the port is open for external access:

Let's try to install netstat first and then check:

Great! The application is listening on port 3001. Now we need to make sure the AWS security group allows traffic on port 3001. Let's check if we can access the application from outside:

Let's enable the firewall and allow port 3001:

Great! Now let's check if the application is accessible from the outside:

Let's try a different approach to check if the application is accessible:

Based on the search results, let's check if port 3001 is open in the AWS security group:

Let's try to open the AWS security group directly:

Let's check if we can access the application from the public IP address:

Let's try to configure the AWS security group using the AWS Management Console. You'll need to:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console
2. Navigate to EC2 > Security Groups
3. Find the security group associated with your EC2 instance
4. Click "Edit inbound rules"
5. Add a new rule: Custom TCP, Port 3001, Source 0.0.0.0/0 (or your specific IP if you want to restrict access)
6. Save the rules

Once you've done that, your application should be accessible from the outside.

Here's a summary of what we've done:

1. Successfully transferred your project files to the EC2 instance
2. Fixed the missing package.json issue
3. Installed dependencies
4. Built the Next.js application
5. Set up PM2 to run the application as a service that starts on boot
6. Configured the firewall on the EC2 instance to allow traffic on port 3001

The last step is to configure the AWS security group to allow external access to port 3001. You'll need to do this through the AWS Management Console as described above.

After that, you should be able to access your application at http://13.200.169.43:3001 from anywhere on the internet.
